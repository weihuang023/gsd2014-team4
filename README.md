## User-Center Design
The importance of user-centered design in software development is to understand the user's experience and environment when they are using the product. The user's experience is relate to the software development because it is the basic idea to design the application with the user's requirement. However, the user's environment is important information for the designer to make changes on the project. The combination of experience and environment will create the scene that explain how the product will play out for the user. Also, the designer should be create the useful product for user to be handy when they use the product. Our excise shows the steps that user use the product and provide the testing information from the user experience. We learned that we must always keep the user in mind as we develop the app, or else we will lose perspective on who the app is really for. We have also gathered the basic information from user's aspect and inspired our project by creating add new idea into the product.
